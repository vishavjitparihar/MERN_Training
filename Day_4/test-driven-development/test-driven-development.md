# what is test driven development or TDD
it is a methodology that promotes the following cycle:

1. Write a unit test
2. Write code to make that unit test pass
3. When code refactoring is to occur repeat the steps all over again for each new feature


# Unit Test
Test for an individual 'unit' of the application
- functions
- classes

The advantage of Unit test is to ensure working code


# jest 
Unit testing framework for JavaScript
Has good integration with React

A jest test file is a JS file that either ends in .test.js or spec.js or resides in a __tests__ folder
